WEBCAM FACE DETECTION

This code captures real-time video from a webcam using JavaScript in Google Colab, processes it with OpenCV, and overlays detected face bounding boxes. It first imports necessary libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL. The js_to_image function converts JavaScript-captured images into OpenCV format, while bbox_to_bytes converts bounding box overlays to base64 format for rendering. The Haar Cascade classifier detects faces. The take_photo function captures an image from the webcam, detects faces, draws bounding boxes, and saves the image. The video_stream function initializes a JavaScript-based webcam stream, while video_frame retrieves video frames. A loop continuously captures frames, converts them to grayscale, detects faces, and overlays bounding boxes in real-time using NumPy and OpenCV. The bounding box is converted into an image overlay and displayed dynamically. If permission is denied for webcam access, an error occurs. The main goal is to perform real-time face detection in Google Colab using JavaScript and OpenCV, displaying detected faces with bounding boxes while continuously updating the video stream.
